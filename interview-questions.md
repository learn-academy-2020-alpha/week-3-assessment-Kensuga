# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring essentially creating variables with the same names as the keys of your object, and assigning them the corresponding value so that they may be manipulated in any needed way without directly changing the value, and so that you dont have to referance the object when using the variable.

  Researched answer: It's a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: A map can take in two arguments. An argument and a function.

  Researched answer:



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is the blueprint of an object, and an object is an instance of that class.

  Researched answer: Every source of information tells me that map is made to take in two arguments instead of one.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: I actually have no clue.

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: A React.Fragment to my understanding preforms the same action as a div, but is used to encase code without having a huge mass of divs throughout the page.
  
  Researched answer: You can use fragments to create components that return a list of elements without wrapping them in a container or array. This is useful for components that return form and text markup â€” as wrapping the result in a container <div> can cause headaches when styling things

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: If I am understanding the question correctly, I would have to say React is a tool to satisfy that need. It is responsive with its live updates to components, as well as using libraries such as bootstrap, or using flex in your css to make the page scale and move accordingly.

  Researched answer: Google says you can use "Media Quieries", "Fluid Grids" or a "Flexible Grid", and "Flexible Images".
